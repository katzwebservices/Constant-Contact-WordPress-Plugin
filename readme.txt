* <em>Short story:</em> __Improved speed.__ <br /><em>Long story:</em> Fixes major potential bug - if you have noticed your site takes a long time to start loading, it may be because the plugin had been trying to access the Constant Contact API for the list values twice per page load. This structure has been totally revamped, and now the Constant Contact API is only accessed once upon changing settings. This release improves load time considerably by storing that information in the WordPress database. Added `cc_widget_lists_array` option to store Constant Contact lists, so that the API doesn't need to be called every page load. Now, API is only called when the plugin settings are saved.

* Improved redirection upon widget submission; now properly redirects to the page the user was on, instead of the home page
* Added filters for more control over widget output:

	* apply_filters('constant_contact_form_description', $description);
	* apply_filters('constant_contact_form_errors', $errors);
	* apply_filters('constant_contact_form_submit', $submit_button);

= 1.0.10 =

This release improves load time considerably by storing that information in the WordPress database.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a Constant Contact account for this plugin? =
This plugin requires a <a href="http://wordpress.constantcontact.com/index.jsp" rel="nofollow" title="Sign up for Constant Contact">Constant Contact account</a>.

Constant Contact is a great email marketing company -- their rates are determined by the number of contacts in your list, not how many emails you send. This means you can send unlimited emails per month for one fixed rate! <a href="http://wordpress.constantcontact.com/features/signup.jsp" title="Try out Constant Contact today" rel="nofollow">Give it a test run</a>.

= Is there shortcode support? =

### Form Shortcode ###

There is shortcode support for the Form Designer forms: `[constantcontactapi]` with the following options:

<pre>
'formid' => 0, // REQUIRED
'before' => null,
'after' => null,
'redirect_url' => false,
'lists' => array(),
'title' => '',
'exclude_lists' => array(),
'description' => '',
'show_list_selection' => false,
'list_selection_title' => 'Add me to these lists:',
'list_selection_format' => 'checkbox'
</pre>

So to add a form, you would add the following in your content: `[constantcontactapi formid="3"]`

### Event Shortcode ###

To show event details, you can use the `[eventspot]` shortcode with the following options:

<pre>
'id' => null, // Show a specific event; enter Event ID (found on the Events page) to use
'limit' => 3, // Number of events to show by default
'showdescription' => true, // Show event Description
'datetime' => true, // Show event Date & Time
'location' => false, // Show event Location
'map' => false,  // Show map link for Location (if Location is shown)
'calendar' => false, // Show "Add to Calendar" link
'directtoregistration' => false, // Link directly to registration page, rather than event homepage
'newwindow' => false, // Open event links in a new window
'style' => true // Use plugin styles. Disable if you want to use your own styles (CSS)
</pre>

<strong>Sample Event Shortcodes</strong>

* To show event details for 5 events using the default settings, you would use `[eventspot limit=3]`
* To show event details for a single event with the id of `abc123` and also show the location details and map link, you would use: `[eventspot id="abc123" location=true map=true]`
* To use your own CSS file, you would use `[eventspot style=false]`


= How do I use the new `apply_filters()` functionality? (Added 1.1) =
If you want to change some code in the widget, you can use the WordPress `add_filter()` function to achieve this.

You can add code to your theme's `functions.php` file that will modify the widget output. Here's an example:
<pre>
function my_example_function($widget) {
	// The $widget variable is the output of the widget
	// This will replace 'this word' with 'that word' in the widget output.
	$widget = str_replace('this word', 'that word', $widget);
	// Make sure to return the $widget variable, or it won't work!
	return $widget;
}
add_filter('constant_contact_form', 'my_example_function');
</pre>

You can modify the widget output by hooking into any of the filters below in a similar manner.

To modify the Events widget output, start with the following code, again in your theme's `functions.php` file:

<pre>
add_filter('cc_event_output_single', 'cc_event_output_single', 1, 2);

function cc_event_output_single($output, $pieces = array('start'=> '','title'=>'','description'=>'','date'=>'','calendar'=>'','location' => '', 'end'=>'')) {
	// The pieces of each event are stored in the $pieces array
	// So you can modify them and cut and paste in what order you
	// want the pieces to display
	return $pieces['start'].'<dt>Description</dt>'.$pieces['description'].$pieces['date'].$pieces['end'];
}
</pre>

<strong>Some example filters:</strong>

* Entire form output: `constant_contact_form`
* Successful submission message: `constant_contact_form_success`
* Form description text: `constant_contact_form_description` (after it has been modified by `wpautop()`)
* Error message: `constant_contact_form_errors`
* Submit button: `constant_contact_form_submit` (includes entire `input` string)

= My email campaign click data isn't being tracked in Constant Analytics =
Constant Contact does not have built-in Google Analytics "tagging" that would track the click data. When you create links in your Constant Contact campaigns, <strong><a href="http://www.google.com/support/analytics/bin/answer.py?answer=55578" rel="nofollow">use the Google URL Builder</a></strong> to add tags to your links. <strong>Make sure to set the Campaign Medium to `email`!</strong>

When you do that, email click stats will be segmented for you in the Site Traffic box.

= How do I use the Form Designer? =

### Using the new Form Designer
1. Install this plugin.
2. Activate the Constant Contact API: Form Designer plugin
3. Configure the settings on the form designer by updating the settings in the boxes on the left.
4. Next to "Form Name" where it says "Enter form name here," enter your form name.
5. Once you have configured and named your form, click Save Form.
6. In the Appearance menu of the administration, click the Widgets link.
7. Drag the widget named "Constant Contact Form Designer" into the sidebar.
8. Configure the settings shown, then click the "Save" button at the bottom of the widget form.
9. You will see the signup widget you created on your website!
10. To edit the form, return the the Form Designer page (from Step 3) and click on the form tab with the name of the form you would like to edit. Edit the form, then click Update Form. The form will show as updated on your website.

= Form Designer isn't showing up or working =
Form Designer needs to be activated separately from the main plugin (see "How do I use the Form Designer?" above). Once you activate it, if it's still not working, it's likely a server issue.

The problem is that your web server may think that Form Designer is an unwelcome script. In order to fix this, you should <strong>contact your web host and request that they "whitelist your domain for ModSecurity."</strong>.

<a href="http://www.hostgator.com" rel="nofollow">HostGator</a> reps said whitelisting your own domain is <strong>not an issue that affects website security</strong>.

= My gradients aren't working on the Form Designer! =
This plugin uses <a href="http://planetozh.com/blog/my-projects/images-php-gd-gradient-fill/">Ozh's gradient script</a>. Please refer to that page.

= What is the plugin license? =
Good news, this plugin is free for everyone! The plugin is [licensed under the GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt "View the GPL License").


= Registration form =
To make the checkbox appear after the "Signup Title", add the following to your theme's `functions.php` file:

`
add_filter( 'constant_contact_register_checkbox_before', '__return_false' );
`
